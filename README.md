# Web-Application-3
Tis' the final web application attempt. 

It's time for me to stop giving myself an unreasonable amount of time (not enough time) to complete a project. I have done all of the individual pieces of creating a web application. I'm just trying to put them together now, but I realize the journey ahead of me is a long and lonely path if I am to do good on this.

I have two HTML pages completed with scarcely any Javascript and no Python (for the web application part) completed. There is also a part on the home.html page (the last part) that I am unsatisfied with, but I am not sure how to improve. As I am working on another project, it may be some time before I come back here. However, I was really trying to pull off the design of the website. I think I've improved a lot from my other ones, but whew is it a lot of work that's seemingly not enough. I need to make the pages responsive to other screen sizes, but because of how I implemented the design, this process becomes difficult. Until next time!
